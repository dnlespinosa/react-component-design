Designing Components and State 
    Here are some ideas 
    Generally components should be small and DO ONE THING
        this makes them more resuable, easier to debug, etc 

Dont Store Derived Info 
    If one thing can be calculated from another, don't store both
        taskList() {
            const [todos, setTodos] = useState(['wash car', 'wash cat'])
            const [numTodos, setNumTodos] = useState(2);

            return (
                <div>
                    You have {numTodos} task...
                </div>
            )
        }
    In the above example, we don't need the todos and the numTodos, we can already figure out the numTodos from todos.length
